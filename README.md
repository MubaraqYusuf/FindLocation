## ✨ Features

*   🛡️ Requests location permission from the user.
*   🛰️ Fetches the last known location using the `FusedLocationProviderClient`.
*   🗺️ Uses `Geocoder` to convert latitude and longitude into a human-readable address.
*   📱 Displays the following information:
    *   **Latitude:** `[value]`
    *   **Longitude:** `[value]`
    *   **Country Name:** `[Country]`
    *   **Locality:** `[City/Area]`
    *   **Full Address:** `[Street Address]`

## ⚙️ How it Works

1.  **Permission Check:** When the "Get Location"  बटन is clicked, the app first checks if the `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` permission has been granted.
2.  **Permission Request:** If the permission is not granted, it requests the permission from the user.
3.  **Location Fetching:** If the permission is granted, the app uses `FusedLocationProviderClient.getLastLocation()` to retrieve the most recent known location of the device.
4.  **Geocoding:** Once the `Location` object is obtained, `Geocoder.getFromLocation()` is used to get a list of addresses corresponding to the latitude and longitude.
5.  **Display:** The relevant address details are then displayed in their respective TextViews.
